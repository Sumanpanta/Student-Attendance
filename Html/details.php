            <h1>Importance Of Students Attendance System And Ways to use it</h1>
       
           <P>
           <br> To identify the presence of students in school, 
            colleges are one of the 
             very important aspects.
            In the past, we were using traditional system of attendance 
            i.e. muster or notebook to take attendence of the 
            students which is much time consuming and spend their energy 
            much  , to avoid 
            such types of problems while attending,
             we use online attendance system which is much 
            faster, secure and important.
            Students attendance system is developed to solve the problems of the 
            schools traditional attendance.<br>


          <br>Attendance is one of those administrative tasks that must be done at the start of each class.
            It can take up valuable time at the beginning of class and sometimes
            be difficult to manage. Attendance books traditionally are big grids with 
            tiny squares that are hard to read and can be easy to make errors in. 
            With QuickSchools' Online Student Information System (also known as Student Attendance System),
             taking and managing attendance is no longer a h
             assle with our easy to use and robust school attendance system.
             Purpose of Student Attendance Management system in School<br>



            <br>The key purpose of using a student attendance management system in schools is 
            to automate the attendance process. 
             However, besides this, there are a few more important reasons
            to invest in a student attendance management system in schools.<br>

           <br> Attendance Tracking In Real-Time<br>

            <br>A student attendance management system helps to track and store the attendance data in real-time. 
            Besides student and staff attendance, the system also helps school admins in 
            maintaining and tracking leaves applications, arrival & departure times, 
            lunch breaks, and vacations of staff members & students.

            <br> Automate The Payroll Process<br>

            <br>If the Payroll management software is coupled with the attendance management system, 
            then the payroll process becomes automated and more efficient. 
            The school HR can easily track absences and leaves of staff members at one glance,
            and adjust salaries as necessary based on that information.

            <br>Using the system also reduces the chances of errors in the payroll system. 
          Since the biometric system calculates the exact working hours, holidays
          , the HR team is less susceptible to make errors in tabulating the payroll.

            <br> Absence of Proxy Attendance<br>

            <br>In many schools, especially the higher grades, 
            students manipulate the daily attendance with proxies, 
          buddy punching or tampering of records in a matter of concern. 
          Using a biometric/RFID system with an attendance module makes it virtually impossible to 
          fake attendance, as each individualâ€™s biometric information is unique.<br>

        <br>This ensures that the attendance is accurate with no opportunity for student manipulation.
          It also improves the punctuality and the discipline of the students. <br>

       <br>Instant Notification To Parents<br>

        <br>The integration of the student attendance management system allows schools to
        track attendance and absenteeism using biometric data.
        This data is in real-time and the software can send automated emails and messages
          to the parents to notify them immediately if their child fails to make it to class. <br>

      <br>Improved School Security<br>

      <br>Using a student attendance management system with biometric software 
      ensures that only students and employees with valid biometric credentials can access the school. 
    Moreover, the institution can alert the parents about visitors during school hours and keep track of them.<br>
